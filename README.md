**ITS NOT DONE YET**

A very basic Minecraft clone (this is under active development, don't expect anything fantastic).

DISCLAIMER: I went into this project with no idea how to use Three.JS, so I
used AI to learn how to use it. Some small snippets of the code may be 
AI-generated. I just asked it things like "How do I add an object to the scene".

This project serves as a break from my other projects and as practice for 
Three.JS / JavaScript, So I will not post updates very often (If I do at all, that is).
