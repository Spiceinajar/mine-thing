**ITS NOT DONE YET**

A very basic Minecraft clone (this is under active development, don't expect anything fantastic).

DISCLAIMER: I went into this project with no idea how to use Three.JS, so some of the 
code is AI generated (It's not completely AI generated though, I still had to do the 
majority myself. I asked it stuff like "How do i add a thing to the scene?".)

This project serves as a break from my other projects and as practice for 
Three.JS / JavaScript, So I will not post updates very often (If I do at all, that is).
