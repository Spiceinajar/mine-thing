**ITS NOT DONE YET**

A very basic Minecraft clone (the name doesn't have "craft" in it because I was too lazy to add crafting).

DISCLAIMER: I went into this project with no idea how to use Three.JS, so some of the 
code is AI generated (It's not completely AI generated, though. I still had to do the 
majority myself.)

This project serves as a break from my other projects and as practice for 
Three.JS / JavaScript, So I will not post updates very often (If I do at all, that is).
